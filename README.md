Based on SampleBrain

- [x] Build out prototype for splicing together two files
- [x] Add way to specify block size
- [x] Add a way to generate a hash key for a given block of audio data. Allow user to specify the hash function/how accurate it is. E.g. you're basically creating a fingerprint for the audio data.
- [ ] Add egui integration
- [ ] Somehow take volume of a block into play. This isn't happening right now. May need to map the range to min/max
- [ ] Add ability to save file to output directory. Do this automatically so you can get a copy of the audio and iteratively work on things.
- [ ] Add ability to mix to brain keys together
- [ ] Convert any audio input to use same sample rate
- [ ] Add a way to 'splice' the main audio file with blocks from the 'brains'
